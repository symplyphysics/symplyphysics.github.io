Voltage is line integral of electric field
------------------------------------------

In electrostatics, voltage change between two points can be found as the line integral
of the electric field along any path connecting the two points.

**Conditions:**

#. Applies to electrostatic fields, although electrostatic approximation might be
   used for electromagnetic fields at lower frequencies.
