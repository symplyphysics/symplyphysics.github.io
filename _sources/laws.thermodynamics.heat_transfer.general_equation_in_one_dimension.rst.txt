General equation in one dimension
---------------------------------

Heat equation governs heat diffusion, as well as other diffusive processes. It describes
the evolution of heat transferred from hotter to colder environments in time and space.

**Notes:**

#. There is no straghtforward solution to this equation, and it depends on initial
   conditions as well.
#. To get a similar equation for the 3-dimensional case, replace the spatial
   derivative with gradient :math:`\nabla`.
#. Thermal conductivity :math:`k` can depend not only on position, but also on local
   temperature, but this is out of the scope of this law.
