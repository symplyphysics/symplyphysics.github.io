Inductance is magnetic flux over current
========================================

**Inductance** is the tendency of an electrical component to oppose a change in the electric current
flowing through it. It can be defined as the ratio of the total magnetic flux through a circuit
due to the component over the current in it.

**Notes:**

#. This law can be seen as the definition of (self-)inductance for linear magnetic media.
