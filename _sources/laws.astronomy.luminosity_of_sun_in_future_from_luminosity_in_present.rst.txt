Luminosity of Sun in future from luminosity in present
------------------------------------------------------

The luminosity of the Sun in the future can be calculated from the luminosity of the Sun in the present.

**Notes:**

#. The :ref:`formula for luminosity in the past <Luminosity of Sun in past from luminosity in present>`
   is not applicable here due to non-linearity.

**Conditions:**

#. The formula is valid while the Sun is `on the main sequence <https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/infocom/The%20Website/end.html>`__.
