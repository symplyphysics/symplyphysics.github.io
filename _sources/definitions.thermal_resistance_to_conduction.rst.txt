Thermal resistance to conduction
--------------------------------

Thermal resistance to conduction is a physical quantity that was introduced in the engineering
practice for insulators: greater values of thermal resistance mean better insulation properties of
a material of given thickness.

    Thermal resistance to conduction of the insulator, also called R-value.

    Symbol:
        :code:`R`

.. py:data:: slab_thickness

    Thickness of the insulator.

    Symbol:
        :code:`l`

.. py:data:: thermal_conductivity

    Thermal conductivity of the insulating material.

    Symbol:
        :code:`k`

.. py:data:: definition

    :code:`R = l / k`

        .. math::
            R = \frac{l}{k}
