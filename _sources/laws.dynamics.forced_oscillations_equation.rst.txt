Forced oscillations equation
----------------------------

*Forced, or driven, oscillations* are a type of oscillations in the presence of an external driving
force acting on the oscillating system. In the case of an oscillating external force, two angular
frequencies are associated with such a system: (1) the natural angular frequency of the system,
which is the angular frequency the system would oscillate with if no external force were present,
and (2) the angular frequency of the external force driving the oscillations. Such systems can
undergo resonance if the angular frequency of the driving force is close to the natural angular
frequency of the oscillator.
