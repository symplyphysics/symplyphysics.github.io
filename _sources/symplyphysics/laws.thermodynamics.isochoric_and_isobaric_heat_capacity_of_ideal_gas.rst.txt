Isochoric and isobaric heat capacities of ideal gas
---------------------------------------------------

Mayer's relation is the relation between heat capacity at constant pressure and that at
constant volume in the case of an ideal gas.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`R` is the molar gas constant.

**Conditions:**

#. Gas is ideal.
