Thermal de Broglie wavelength
-----------------------------

The thermal de Broglie wavelength can be roughly described as the average de Broglie wavelength
of particles in an ideal gas at a specified temperature. When compared to average interparticle
spacing in the gas, it can be used to tell if the gas can be considered to be a classical or
Maxwell-Boltzmann gas, in which case the thermal wavelength must be much smaller than the average
interparticle spacing. Otherwise, quantum effects must be taken into account.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`\hbar` (:code:`hbar`) is the reduced Planck constant.
#. :math:`k_\text{B}` (:code:`k_B`) is the Boltzmann constant.
