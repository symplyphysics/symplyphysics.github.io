Dimensionless equation
----------------------

The *dimensionless form* of the van der Waals equation of state features :ref:`reduced quantities
<vdw_reduced_units_def>`. One notable property of the dimensionless equation of state is that it
contains no substance-specific quantities, i.e. all van der Waals fluids will plot on the same
reduced pressure-volume curve at the same reduced temperature.
