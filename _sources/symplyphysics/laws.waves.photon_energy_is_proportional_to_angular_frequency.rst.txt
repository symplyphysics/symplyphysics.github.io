Photon energy is proportional to angular frequency
--------------------------------------------------

Photon is the elementary part of any electromagnetical radiation, having no mass and moving with speed of light
in any reference frame. The energy of a photon depends only on its frequency.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`\hbar` (:code:`hbar`) is the reduced Planck constant.
