Latent heat of fusion via mass
------------------------------

*Latent heat of fusion* is the heat released into or withdrawn from the enviroment when
the body changes its state from a solid to a liquid. The same law applies to the process
of solidification, when the body changes its state from a liquid to a solid, and the
specific heat of solidification is equal by magnitude to that of fusion.
