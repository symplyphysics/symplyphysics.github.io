Angular position is arc length over radius
------------------------------------------

To describe the rotation of a rigid body about a fixed rotational axis, a reference line is
assumed to be fixed in the body, perpendicular to that axis and rotating with the body. The angular
position of this is measured relative to a fixed direction and is expressed as a ratio of the arc
length of a circular path and its radius (distance to the axis).
