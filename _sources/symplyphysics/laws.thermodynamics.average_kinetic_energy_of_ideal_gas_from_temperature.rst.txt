Average kinetic energy of ideal gas from temperature
----------------------------------------------------

The kinetic theory of ideal gases allows us to determine the *average kinetic energy* for an ideal gas.
It states that the average kinetic energy for all ideal gases is directly proportional to the absolute
temperature of the gas and only depends on the temperature.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`k_\text{B}` is the Boltzmann constant.

**Conditions:**

#. The gas is ideal.
