Photon energy is proportional to linear frequency
-------------------------------------------------

Photon is the elementary part of any electromagnetical radiation, having no mass and moving with speed of light
in any reference frame. The energy of a photon depends only on its frequency.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`h` is the Planck constant.
