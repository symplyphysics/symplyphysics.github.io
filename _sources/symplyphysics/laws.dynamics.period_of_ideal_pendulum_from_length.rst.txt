Period of ideal pendulum from length
------------------------------------

An ideal pendulum is an object hanging on a thread. In a gravitational field it starts oscillating after being pushed out of balance.
Period of pendulum oscillation does not depend on its mass.

**Conditions:**

#. The angle between pendulum and gravity vector is fairly small (less than 15 degrees).
#. Ideal pendulum doesn't gain or lose any energy, so there is no friction in the system.
#. The object is small enough to be considered a material point.
#. The thread is weightless and doesn't change its length.
