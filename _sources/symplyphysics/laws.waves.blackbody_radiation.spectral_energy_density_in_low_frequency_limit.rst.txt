Spectral energy density at low frequency limit
----------------------------------------------

The *Rayleigh-Jeans law* is an approximation to the spectral radiance of electromagnetic radiation
as a function of wave frequency from a blackbody at a given temperature through classical arguments.
The Rayleigh-Jeans law agrees with experimental results at large wavelengths (i.e. at low frequencies)
but strongly disagrees at short wavelengths (i.e. at high frequencies). This inconsistency is commonly
known as the *ultraviolet catastrophe*.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`c` is the speed of light.
#. :math:`k_\text{B}` (:code:`k_B`) is the Boltzmann constant.

**Conditions:**

#. The black body is isolated from the environment.
#. :math:`h \nu \ll k_\text{B} T`, i.e. photon energy is much smaller than thermal energy.
