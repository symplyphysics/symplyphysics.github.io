Dynamic viscosity of gas from temperature
-----------------------------------------

Viscosity is a phenomenon of molecular transport, the property of fluid bodies (liquids and gases)
to resist the movement of one part of them relative to another. As a result, the macroscopic work
expended on this movement is dissipated as heat. Unlike liquids, the viscosity of gases increases
with increasing temperature, whereas for liquids it decreases with increasing temperature.

**Conditions:**

#. The gas is ideal.
