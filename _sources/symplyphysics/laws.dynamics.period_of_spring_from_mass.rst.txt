Period of spring from mass
--------------------------

Mass on spring is a system of object with mass :math:`m` and spring with stiffness :math:`k`.
It starts oscillating after being pushed out of balance.

**Conditions:**

#. The spring does not gain or lose energy. There is no friction or inelastic deformation.
#. The object is small enough to be considered a material point.
#. The spring is weightless.
