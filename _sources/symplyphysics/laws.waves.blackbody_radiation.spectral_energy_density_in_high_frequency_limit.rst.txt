Spectral energy density at high frequency limit
-----------------------------------------------

*Wien's approximation*, also known as *Wien distribution law*, describes the spectrum of blackbody
thermal radiation. It accurately describes short-wavelength (i.e. high-frequency) spectrum of
thermal emission, but fails to do that for long-wavelength (i.e. low-frequency) emission.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`h` is the Planck constant.
#. :math:`c` is the speed of light.
#. :math:`k_\text{B}` (:code:`k_B`) is the Boltzmann constant.

**Conditions:**

#. The black body is isolated from the environment.
#. :math:`h \nu \gg k_\text{B} T`, i.e. photon energy is much greater than thermal energy.
