Canonical partition function of a classical discrete system
-----------------------------------------------------------

Let us assume a canonical ensemble, i.e. a thermodynamically large system that is in thermal contact
with the environment, with a temperature T and whose volume and number of constituent particles remain
constant. For a classical discrete system the partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors
of all the possible energy states:
