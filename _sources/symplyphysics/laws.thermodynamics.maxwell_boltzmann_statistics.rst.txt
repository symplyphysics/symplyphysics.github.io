**Maxwell—Boltzmann statistics**
================================

In statistical mechanics, Maxwell—Boltzmann statistics describes the distribution of classical material
particles over various energy states in thermal equilibrium. It is applicable when the temperature is
high enough or the particle density is low enough to render quantum effects negligible.
