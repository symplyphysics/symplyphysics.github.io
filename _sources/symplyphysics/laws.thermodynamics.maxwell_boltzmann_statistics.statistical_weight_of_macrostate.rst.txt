Statistical weight of macrostate
--------------------------------

If a physical system can be described as having several states which can be occupied by
different numbers of particles but with the total number of particles being conserved and
a condition that all allowed microstates of the closed system are equiprobable, the formula
for the statistical weight of the system can be found in combinatorics.

**Notes:**

#. Law can also be represented in form :math:`W = \frac{N!}{\prod_i (N_i!)}`
   (:code:`W = factorial(N) / Product(factorial(N_i), i)`)
