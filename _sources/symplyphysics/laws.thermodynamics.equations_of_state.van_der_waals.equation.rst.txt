Van der Waals equation
----------------------

To more accurately describe the behavior of real gases at low temperatures,
a Van der Waals gas model was created, taking into account the forces of intermolecular interaction.
In this model, internal energy becomes a function not only of temperature, but also of molar volume.

The Van der Waals equation is one of the well-known approximate equations of state describing
the properties of a real gas, having a compact form and taking
into account the main characteristics of a gas with intermolecular interaction.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`R` is the molar gas constant.
