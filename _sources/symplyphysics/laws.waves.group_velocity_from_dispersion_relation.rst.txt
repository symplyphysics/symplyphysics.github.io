Group velocity from dispersion relation
---------------------------------------

Waves can form a group, called wave packets. The speed with which a wave packet travels
is called group velocity. In other words, it is the speed with which the overall envelope
shape of the wave's amplitudes — called envelope of modulation of the wave — propagates
through space.
