Gas mixture pressure from partial pressures
-------------------------------------------

The pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of their partial pressures. *Partial pressure*
of a gas is the pressure that the gas would exert on the walls of a vessel when it is the only gas present
in the vessel.
