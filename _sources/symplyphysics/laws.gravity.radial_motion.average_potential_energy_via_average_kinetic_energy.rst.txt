Average potential energy via average kinetic energy
---------------------------------------------------

The average potential energy of an orbiting planet is directly proportional to its average
kinetic energy. The average of both energies is taken w.r.t. time.

**Conditions:**

#. Works for elliptical orbits, i.e. the total energy :math:`E` of the planet is negative.

**Notes:**

#. :code:`<A>` denotes the average of the quantity :code:`A`.
