Hydrostatic pressure via density and height
-------------------------------------------

Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by a fluid at equilibrium at any point of time
due to the force of gravity.

**Conditions:**

#. The fluid is in statical equilibrium.
#. The only force acting on the fluid is the force of gravity.
#. The fluid is subjected to the gravity force of Earth.
