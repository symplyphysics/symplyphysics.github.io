Speed of sound in ideal gas
---------------------------

Also known as the Laplace's formula of the speed of sound, it provides a correct expression
for the speed of sound for ideal gases compared to the Newton's formula. See
:doc:`laws.thermodynamics.isentropic_speed_of_sound_via_pressure_derivative`.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`R` is the molar gas constant.
