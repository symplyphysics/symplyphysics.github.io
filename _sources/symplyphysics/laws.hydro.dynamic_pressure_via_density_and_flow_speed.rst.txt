Dynamic pressure from speed
---------------------------

*Dynamic pressure*, sometimes called *velocity pressure*, is a physical quantity denoting the
pressure caused by a flowing fluid. It is numerically equal to the kinetic energy of the
fluid per unit volume (see :doc:`laws.quantities.quantity_is_volumetric_density_times_volume`).

**Notes:**

#. Many authors define this quantity only for *incompressible flows*, but others extend it for
   compressible flows as well.
