Entropy change in reversible process
------------------------------------

The second law of thermodynamics applied to a closed system and an idealized, reversible or quasistatic process,
states that in such a process of transfer of energy as heat to closed thermodynamic system :math:`B`, which
allows energy but not matter exchanges, from an auxiliary thermodynamic system :math:`A`, an infinitesimal
increment in the entropy of system :math:`B` is defined to result from an infinitesimal transfer of heat to
system :math:`B` divided by the common thermodynamic temperature of systems :math:`A` and :math:`B`.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`\delta` (:code:`delta`) denotes an inexact, path-dependent differential.
#. :math:`d` denotes an exact, path-independent differential.

**Notes:**

#. Also applicable to actually possible quasi-static irreversible processes without composition change
