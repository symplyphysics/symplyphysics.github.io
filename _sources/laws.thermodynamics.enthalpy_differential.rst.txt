Enthalpy differential
---------------------

The fundamental thermodynamic relations are fundamental equations which demonstate how the important
thermodynamic quantities depend on variables that are measurable experimentally.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`d` denotes an exact, path-independent differential.

**Notes:**

#. Entropy, pressure, and particle count are so called natural variables of enthalpy as a
   thermodynamic potential.
#. For a system with more than one type of particles, the last term can be represented as a sum over all
   types of particles, i.e. :math:`\sum_i \mu_i \, d N_i`.

**Conditions:**

#. The system is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.
#. The system is composed of only one type of particles, i.e. the system is a pure substance.
