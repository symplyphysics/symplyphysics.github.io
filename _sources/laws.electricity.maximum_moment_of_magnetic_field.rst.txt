Magnetic moment via current and contour area
--------------------------------------------

The **magnetic moment** is the main physical quantity characterizing the magnetic
properties of a substance, that is, the ability to create and perceive a magnetic
field.

**Conditions:**

#. Ideally, the conductor itself should be infinitely thin. But a conductor can have
   any shape and size if its dimensions can be neglected relative to the size of the
   closed circuit that it forms.

#. The plane must be flat for this formula to be applicable, and the current must
   only make one turn around the contour.
