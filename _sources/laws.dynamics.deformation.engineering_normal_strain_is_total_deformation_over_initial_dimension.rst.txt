Engineering normal strain is total deformation over initial dimension
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*Engineering normal strain*, also called *Cauchy strain*, is expressed as the ratio of total
deformation to the initial dimension of a material body on which forces are applied.

.. py:data:: engineering_normal_strain

    *Engineering normal strain*, also known as *engineering extensional strain*, is equal to
    the *relative elongation* of the body.

.. py:data:: total_deformation

    Total deformation of the body, which is the change in length in case of the engineering
    normal strain.

    Symbol:
        :code:`dl`

    Latex:
        :math:`\Delta l`

.. py:data:: initial_dimension

    Initial dimension of the body, e.g. initial length.

    Symbol:
        :code:`l`

.. py:data:: law

    :code:`e = dl / l`

    Latex:
        .. math::
            e = \frac{\Delta l}{l}
