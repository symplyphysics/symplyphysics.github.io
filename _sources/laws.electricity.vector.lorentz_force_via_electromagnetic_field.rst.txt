Lorentz force via electromagnetic field
---------------------------------------

The **Lorentz force law** states that a charged particle moving in an electromagnetic
field experiences a force that depends on the values of the electric field and the
magnetic field.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`\vec a \times \vec b` (:code:`cross(a, b)`) is the cross product between
   :math:`\vec a` and :math:`\vec b`.
#. :math:`\lVert \vec a \rVert` (:code:`norm(a)`) is the Euclidean norm of :math:`\vec a`.
#. :math:`|x|` (:code:`abs(x)`) is the absolute value of :math:`x`.

**Notes:**

#. This law is valid even in the relativistic case.
#. This law works only in principle because a real particle would generate its own
   electromagnetic field that would interact with the external one which would alter
   the electromagnetic force it experiences.
