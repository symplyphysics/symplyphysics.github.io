Total work is change in kinetic energy
--------------------------------------

The work-energy principle states that the work done by all forces acting on a particle
(the work of the resultant force) equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.laws.dynamics.total_work_is_change_in_kinetic_energy

.. py:data:: work

    The total work done on the body.

    Symbol:
        :code:`W`

.. py:data:: kinetic_energy

    The kinetic energy of the body.

    Symbol:
        :code:`K(t)`

.. py:data:: time_before

    The time before the work has been done.

    Symbol:
        :code:`t0`

    Latex:
        :math:`t_0`

.. py:data:: time_after

    The time after the work has been done.

    Symbol:

    Latex:
        :math:`t_1`

.. py:data:: law

    :code:`W = K(t1) - K(t0)`

    Latex:
        .. math::
            W = K(t_1) - K(t_0)
