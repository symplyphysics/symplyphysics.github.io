Compliance is inverse stiffness
===============================

*Compliance* (also called *flexibility*) quantifies how much a system deforms under load; for an ideal linear spring it is the reciprocal of its stiffness.

**Conditions:**

#. This law holds locally (i.e. at a specific point along the spring), and is always true when stiffness is constant throughout the spring.
#. Deformation remains within the elastic (Hookean) range.
