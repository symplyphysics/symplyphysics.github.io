Fully constructive interference condition
-----------------------------------------

The interference of two waves is said to be *fully constructive* when the amplitude of the
resulting wave is precisely the sum of the amplitudes of the comprising waves. In that case,
there must be an even number of half-cycles out of phase between each other.
