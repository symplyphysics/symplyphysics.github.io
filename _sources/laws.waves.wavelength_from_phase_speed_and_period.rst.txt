Wavelength from phase speed and period
--------------------------------------

Wavelength is the spatial period of a periodic wave, i.e. the distance the wave needs to travel
for its shape to repeat. It can also be measured as the distance between two closest points
with the same wave phase.

.. py:data:: wavelength

    Wavelength of the wave.
