Thermodynamic compressibility
-----------------------------

*Compressibility*, or the *coefficient of compressibility*, is a measure of the instantaneous
relative volume change of a fluid or solid as a response to pressure or mean stress change.

**Notes:**

#. This definition is incomplete in the sense that the value of the compressibility coefficient
   depends on whether the process is isentropic or isothermal, hence the partial derivative should
   be taken at either constant entropy or constant temperature.
#. For solids the difference between isentropic and isothermal compressibility coefficients
   is usually negligible.
