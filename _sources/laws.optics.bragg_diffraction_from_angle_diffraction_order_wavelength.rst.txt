Bragg diffraction from angle of diffraction and wavelength
----------------------------------------------------------

Diffraction from a three-dimensional periodic structure such as atoms in a crystal is called Bragg's
diffraction. This is similar to what happens when waves are scattered on a diffraction grating. Bragg's
diffraction is a consequence of interference between waves reflected from crystal planes.

**Conditions:**

#. The scattering of light on the atomic planes is specular (mirror-like).
#. The incident and scattered light and the light inside the crystal have the same wavelength.

.. py:data:: diffraction_order

    **Diffraction order** indicates the number of integer wavelengths that fit in the total
    light path so that the light waves could constructively interfere. See :attr:`~symplyphysics.symbols.basic.positive_number`.

    :attr:`~symplyphysics.symbols.classical_mechanics.wavelength` of the incident and scattered light.

    The **glancing angle** is the :attr:`~symplyphysics.symbols.basic.angle` that complements the angle of incidence of the beam
    up to a right angle.
