Electric dipole moment is charge times distance
-----------------------------------------------

Electric dipole moment is a measure of the separation of positive and negative
electrical charges within a system, i.e. it is a measure of the system's overall
polarity. Also see :doc:`vector counterpart <laws.electricity.vector.electric_dipole_moment_is_charge_times_displacement>`.

**Conditions:**

#. The system can be viewed as composed of two point charges.
#. The point charges are equal by magnitude.
