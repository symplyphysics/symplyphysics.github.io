Displacement in critical damping
--------------------------------

In the presence of a damping force in the oscillating system, the system's behavior
depends on the value of the damping ratio. When it is equal to :math:`1`, the system returns
to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating, but overshoot can occur if
initial velocity is nonzero. This behavior is also called *critical damping*.

**Conditions:**

#. The system is critically damped, i.e. its damping ratio :math:`\zeta = 1`.
