Relative speed of rocket depends on mass and impulse
----------------------------------------------------

The Tsiolkovsky formula determines the speed that an aircraft develops under the influence of the thrust
of a rocket engine, unchanged in direction, in the absence of all other forces.
For a rocket flying at a speed close to the speed of light, the generalized Tsiolkovsky formula is valid,
in which the speed of light is present.
