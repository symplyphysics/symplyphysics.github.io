Electrostatic force via charges and distance
============================================

The *Coulomb's law* states that the electrostatic force between two point charges
in a vacuum is proportional to their values and inversely proportional to the
square of the distance between them.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`\varepsilon_0` (:code:`epsilon_0`) is :attr:`~symplyphysics.quantities.vacuum_permittivity`.

**Notes:**

#. Per this law, positive force indicated that the two charges repel (both
   charges are of the same sign), and negative force indicates that they
   attract one another (the charges are oppositely charged).
