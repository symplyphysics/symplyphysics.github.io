Electrostatic potential is work to bring from reference point over charge
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Electrostatic potential is a physical quantity defined as the amount of
work needed per unit electric charge to move it from a reference point,
usually infinity, to a specific point in an electric field.

Infinity is usually used as the reference point because this would make
the potential approach zero at an infinitely remote point.

**Notes:**

#. The electric potential is defined up to a constant.
