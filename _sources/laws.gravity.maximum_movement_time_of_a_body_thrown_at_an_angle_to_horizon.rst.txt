Time of flight of a projectile via initial velocity
===================================================

Let the body be thrown at an angle to the horizon with some initial velocity. Then the time of the motion
of this body until it reaches the initial elevation depends only on initial velocity and acceleration
of free fall.

**Conditions:**

#. The acceleration of gravity stays constant throughout the movement of the body.

#. The initial and final height of the body with respect to the "ground" are the same,
   i.e. the body lands on a point with the same vertical coordinate as at the start
   of the flight.
