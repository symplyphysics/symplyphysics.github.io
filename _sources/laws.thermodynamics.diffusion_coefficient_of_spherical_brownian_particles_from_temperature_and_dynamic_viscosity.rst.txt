Diffusion coefficient of spherical Brownian particles from temperature and dynamic viscosity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brownian motion is the random motion of microscopic visible suspended particles of a solid
substance in a liquid or gas caused by the thermal motion of particles of a liquid or gas.
The *diffusion coefficient* is a quantitative characteristic of the diffusion rate, equal to
the amount of matter passing per unit time through a section of a unit area as a result of
the thermal motion of molecules with a concentration gradient equal to one (corresponding to
a change from :math:`1 \frac{\text{mol}}{\text{L}}` to :math:`0 \frac{\text{mol}}{\text{L}}`
per unit length). The diffusion coefficient is determined by the properties of the medium and
the type of diffusing particles. This law is also known as the *Stokes—Einstein—Sutherland relation*.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`R` is the molar gas constant.
#. :math:`N_\text{A}` is the Avogadro constant.

**Conditions:**

#. Particle displacements are equally likely in any direction.
#. The inertia of a Brownian particle can be neglected compared to the influence of friction forces.
#. Particles are spherical.
#. Low Reynolds number, i.e. non-turbulent flow.
