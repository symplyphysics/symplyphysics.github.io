Drift velocity of charge carriers
=================================

Drift velocity is the average velocity attained by charged particles, such as electrons,
in a material due to an electric field. In general, an electron in a conductor will
propagate randomly at the Fermi velocity, resulting in an average velocity of zero.
Applying an electric field adds to this random motion a small net flow in one direction;
this is the drift.
