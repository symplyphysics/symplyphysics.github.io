.. py:data:: speed

    Velocity of the body as a function of time.

    Symbol:
        :code:`v(t)`

.. py:data:: distance

    Distance traveled by the body as a function of time.

    Symbol:
        :code:`s(t)`

.. py:data:: time

    Travel time.

    Symbol:
        :code:`t`

.. py:data:: definition

    :code:`v(t) = Derivative(s(t), t)`
