Speed via constant acceleration and time
========================================

If a body is moving with constant acceleration, its speed can be expressed as a linear function
of time.

**Conditions:**

#. Acceleration is constant, i.e. :math:`\frac{d a}{d t} = 0.`

**Links:**

#. `Wikipedia, vector counterpart of this law <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics#Relative_acceleration>`__.
