Absolute velocity of arbitrary motion
-------------------------------------

Imagine two reference frames, one of which is fixed (:math:`S`) and the other one is moving arbitrarily (:math:`S'`). The motion of the
body relative to fixed frame :math:`S` is called *absolute motion*. The motion of the body relative to moving frame :math:`S'`
is called *relative motion*. The motion of the body due to the motion of reference frame :math:`S'` is called *transfer
motion*. Absolute velocity is the sum of relative and transfer velocities.

**Notes:**

#. Moving frame :math:`S'` can perform both translational and rotational motion.
