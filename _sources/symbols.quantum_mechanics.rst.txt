Quantum Mechanics (Symbols)
===========================

Symbols related to quantum mechanics.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.symbols.quantum_mechanics

.. py:data:: wave_function

    The **wave function** is a complex-valued quantity describing the quantum state of an isolated quantum system.

Symbol:
    :code:`psi`

Latex:
    :math:`\psi`

Dimension:
    :code:`1/sqrt(length)`


.. py:data:: probability_density

    The **probability density**, or **probability amplitude**, is a real number that provides a relationship between
    the quantum state vector of a system and the results of observations of that system. It is the likelihood of
    finding an object or system in a particular state at a particular position and time.
