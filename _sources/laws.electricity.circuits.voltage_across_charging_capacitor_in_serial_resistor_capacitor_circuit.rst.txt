Voltage across charging capacitor in serial resistor-capacitor circuit
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A series circuit containing only a resistor, a capacitor, a switch and a constant DC source of voltage
is known as a charging circuit. The capacitor is initially uncharged while the switch is open. The switch
is closed at :math:`t = 0`. Afterwards, the capacitor begins to charge and the voltage across it rises
while the voltage across the resistor begins to drop. Note that the voltage across the capacitor never
reaches the voltage of the source.
