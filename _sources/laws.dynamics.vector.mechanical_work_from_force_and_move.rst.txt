Mechanical work from force and displacement
===========================================

Work is measured result of force applied. Mechanical work is the only reason for the object energy
to be changed. Work is a scalar value equal to the dot product of force and displacement vectors.

**Conditions:**

#. Force must be constant during the body's displacement. This is possible when the displacement is
   infinitesimally small. For the case non-constant force and/or finite displacement, refer to
   :ref:`Mechanical work is line integral of force`.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`\left( \vec a, \vec b \right)` (:code:`dot(a, b)`) is the dot product between
   vectors :math:`\vec a` and :math:`\vec b`.
