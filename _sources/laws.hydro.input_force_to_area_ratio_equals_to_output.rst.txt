Force to area ratio in hydraulic press
--------------------------------------

If both vertically positioned cylinders of communicating vessels are closed with
pistons, then with the help of external forces applied to the pistons, a large pressure
can be created in the liquid, many times exceeding the hydrostatic pressure at any point
in the system. If the pistons have different areas, then different forces act on them
from the liquid side. The same modulus, but oppositely directed external forces must be
applied to the pistons to keep the system in balance.


**Conditions:**

#. This ratio is performed only in an ideal hydraulic press, i.e. one in which there is
   no friction.
