Spring reaction is proportional to deformation (vector)
=======================================================

The empirical law known as **Hooke's law** states that that the force needed to extend or compress
a spring by some distance scales linearly with respect to that distance. Also see the :ref:`scalar
counterpart <Spring reaction is proportional to deformation>` of this law.

**Conditions:**

#. The deformations are elastic (reversible).

#. The stiffness coefficient is a scalar.
