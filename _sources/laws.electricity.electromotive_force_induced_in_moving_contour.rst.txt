Electromotive force induced in moving contour
---------------------------------------------

The **Faraday's law** states that the electromotive force around a closed path is equal to
the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic flux enclosed by the path. In case
of the current making several turns around the contour, e.g. in a coil, the electromotive force
would also be proportional to the number of turn the current makes.
