Laplace pressure is pressure difference
=======================================

The **Laplace pressure** is the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of a curved
surface that forms the boundary between two fluid regions. This is caused by the surface tension at
the fluid interface.

The terms *outside* and *inside* are related to the direction dictated by the curvature of the
interface, not by the position relative to the fluid in question.
