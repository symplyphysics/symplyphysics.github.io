Current is voltage over impedance
=================================

Alternating current flowing through an electric component is proportional to voltage applied to it
and inversely proportional to its impedance. This is the complex generalization of the :ref:`Ohm's
law <Current is voltage over resistance>`.

**Notes:**

#. This is a phenomenological equation.

**Conditions:**

#. The material must be ohmic, i.e. current must be proportional to voltage.

#. The AC circuit must be time-invariant.
