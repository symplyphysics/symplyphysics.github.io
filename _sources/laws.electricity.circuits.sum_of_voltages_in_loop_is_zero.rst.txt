Sum of voltages in loop is zero
===============================

The directed sum of the potential differences, or voltages, around any closed loop
is zero. Directed sum implies that the sign of the voltages must be taken into account.
This law is also known as **Kirchhoff's second law**, or **Kirchhoff's loop rule**.
