Admittance is inverse impedance
===============================

*Admittance* (sometimes called complex conductance) describes how easily alternating current flows through a network. It is defined as the reciprocal of impedance.

Also see :doc:`Impedance law <definitions.impedance_is_resistance_and_reactance>`

**Conditions:**

#. Applicable under sinusoidal steady-state (phasor-domain) analysis for linear, time-invariant systems.
