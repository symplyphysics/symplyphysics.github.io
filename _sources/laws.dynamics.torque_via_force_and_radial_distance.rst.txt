Torque via force and radial distance
------------------------------------

*Torque* is a turning action on a body about a rotation axis due to a force.

**Notes:**

#. The position vector of a point in space, also known as location or radius vector,
   is the vector connecting the origin of the coordinate system and the given point.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.laws.dynamics.torque_via_force_and_radial_distance

.. py:data:: torque

    The magnitude of the torque applied at the given point.

    Symbol:
        :code:`tau`

    Latex:
        :math:`\tau`

.. py:data:: force

    The magnitude of the :attr:`~symplyphysics.symbols.dynamics.force` exerted on the given point.

    Symbol:
        :code:`F`

    Latex:
        :math:`F`

    Dimension:
        :code:`force`

.. py:data:: radial_distance

    The distance to axis from the given point.

    Symbol:
        :code:`r`

.. py:data:: angle_between_vectors

    The angle between the position vector of the given point and the force vector.

    Symbol:
        :code:`phi`

    Latex:
        :math:`\varphi`

.. py:data:: law

    :code:`tau = F * r * sin(phi)`

    Latex:
        .. math::
            \tau = F r \sin{\varphi}
