Electric flux of uniform electric field
---------------------------------------

Electric field at a point in space can be found by placing there a test charge and measuring
the electrostatic force that is applied to it.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`\vec a \cdot \vec b` (:code:`dot(a, b)`) is the dot product between vectors
   :math:`\vec a` and :math:`\vec b`.

**Notes:**

#. Vector area is a vector quantity whose magnitude denotes the area of the surface it
   represents and whose direction denotes the orientation of the surface.

**Conditions:**

#. The electric field is uniform. This might be achieved by choosing a small enough surface
   that the electric field would be constant throughout it.
