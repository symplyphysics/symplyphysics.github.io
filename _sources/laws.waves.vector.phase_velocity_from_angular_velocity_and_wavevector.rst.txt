Phase velocity from angular velocity and wavevector
===================================================

The phase velocity of a wave is the rate at which the wave propagates in a medium. It is the
velocity at which the phase of one frequency component of the wave travels. The phase velocity is
collinear with the wavevector.

**Notes:**

#. Angular wavevector is a vector used in describing a wave. Its magnitude is the angular
   wavenumber of the wave. Its direction is perpendicular to the wavefront, and in isotropic media
   it is also the direction of wave propagation.

#. Also see the :ref:`scalar counterpart <Phase speed from angular frequency and wavenumber>` of
   this law.
