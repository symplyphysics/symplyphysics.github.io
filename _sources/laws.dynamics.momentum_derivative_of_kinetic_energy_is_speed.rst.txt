Momentum derivative of kinetic energy is speed
----------------------------------------------

The general formula for the kinetic energy of an object features its speed and momentum. This way it can be used
not only in the case of variable mass, but also in the relativistic case.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.laws.dynamics.momentum_derivative_of_kinetic_energy_is_speed

.. py:data:: kinetic_energy

    The kinetic energy of the object.

    Symbol:
        :code:`K(p(v))`

.. py:data:: momentum

    The momentum of the object.

    Symbol:
        :code:`p(v)`

.. py:data:: speed

    The speed of the object.

    Symbol:
        :code:`v`

.. py:data:: law

    :code:`Derivative(K(p(v), p(v))) = v`

    Latex:
        .. math::
            \frac{d K(p(v))}{d p(v)} = v
