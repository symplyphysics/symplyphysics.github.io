Optics
======

*Optics* is the branch of physics which is concerned with light and its behavioural
pattern and properties. Optics is a branch of physics that deals with the determination
of behaviour and the properties of light, along with its interactions with the matter
and also with the instruments which are used to detect it.

.. _small_angle_def:

**Small-angle approximation**

Approximation that is valid when the size of a spherical mirror is significantly smaller
than the mirror's radius; in this approximation, spherical aberration is negligible and
the mirror has a well-defined focal point.
