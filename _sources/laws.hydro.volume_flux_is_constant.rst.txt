Volume flux is constant
-----------------------

The product of the area and the fluid speed, which is called the *volume flux*, is constant
at all points along the tube of flow of an incompressible liquid. This equation is also
known as the *equation of continuity*.

**Conditions:**

#. The fluid is :ref:`ideal <ideal_fluid_def>`.
