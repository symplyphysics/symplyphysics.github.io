Heat capacity ratio
-------------------

The *heat capacity ratio*, also known as the *adiabatic index*, the *ratio of specific heats*, or
the *insentropic expansion factor*, is the ratio of the heat capacity at constant pressure
to that of constant volume. The heat capacity ratio is used in the description of thermodynamic
reversible processes; the speed of sound also depends on this factor.

**Notes:**

#. One can also use intensive heat capacities, such as specific or molar ones, in place of the 
   extensive heat capacity presented here.
