Acceleration is normal plus tangential acceleration
---------------------------------------------------

The acceleration of a body moving arbitrarily is composed of two parts:

#. *normal, or centripetal, acceleration*, which is always present in a rotating environment
   and points to the instantaneous axis of rotation,
#. and *tangential acceleration*, which is responsible for the change in the magnitude of
   the velocity vector.
