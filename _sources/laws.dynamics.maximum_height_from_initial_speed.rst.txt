Maximum height from initial speed
=================================

The maximum height that a body thrown vertically will rise to depends on the initial speed.

**Notes:**

#. If the body is launched at an arbitrary angle to the horizontal, this formula is still
   applicable but you must use the projection of the velocity vector on the :math:`z` axis as the
   initial speed.

**Conditions:**

#. The body is thrown "upwards", i.e. in the direction opposite to that of the free fall
   acceleration vector.
