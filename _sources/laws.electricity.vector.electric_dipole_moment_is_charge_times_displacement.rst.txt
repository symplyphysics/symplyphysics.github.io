Electric dipole moment is charge times displacement
---------------------------------------------------

The vector of electric dipole moment is a vector whose magnitude describes the
:doc:`electric dipole moment <laws.electricity.electric_dipole_moment_is_charge_times_distance>`
of the system. It is collinear to the vector connecting the two point charges.

**Conditions:**

#. The charges must be equal by magnitude and have opposite signs.
