Circulation is integral along curve
===================================

The circulation of a vector field along a closed curve is defined via a curvilinear integral of
the field along the curve.

**Conditions:**

#. The parametrization of the curve is a vector function of one parameter that is continuously
   differentiable with respect to it.
#. The curve is closed.
