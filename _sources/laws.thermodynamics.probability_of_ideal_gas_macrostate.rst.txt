Probability of ideal gas macrostate
-----------------------------------

Suppose there is a vessel of volume :math:`V` with :math:`N` identical ideal gas particles whose movement is described
by classical mechanics. Let us divide the volume of the vessel into :math:`m` small enough cells with volumes :math:`V_1`
up to :math:`V_m`. Let us for a moment also attach a number to each gas particle to be able to tell them apart.

The *microstate* of the gas is the complete description of

#. the particle count of each cell of the vessel
#. the particles of which numbers appear in each cell.

A particle moving within the same cell does not change the microstate of the gas, but a particle moving
from one cell to another does.

The *macrostate* of the gas only requires the description of the particle count in each cell of the vessel.
If we assume the particles to be identical, it doesn't make a difference, from a macroscopic standpoint, particles
of which number appear in which cells. Hence the probability of the macrostate is larger than that of the microstate
by the factor of the number of permutations of the particles among the cells, which is exactly the statistical weight
of the macrostate.

**Conditions:**

#. There are no external fields acting on the system.
#. All particles are identical.
#. The gas is ideal.
#. Probabilities must sum up to :math:`1`.
