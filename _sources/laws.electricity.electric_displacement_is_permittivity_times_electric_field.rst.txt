Electric displacement is permittivity times electric field
----------------------------------------------------------

In a linear, homogeneous, isotropic dielectric the electric displacement is linearly
proportional to the electric field strength, with the constant of proprortionality
being the permittivity of the medium.

**Notes:**

#. If the medium is anisotropic, the relation between electric displacement and
   electric field is similar, but permittivity is now a tensor and not a scalar.

#. In a nonhomogeneous medium, permittivity is a function of position inside the medium.

#. In a nonlinear medium, permittivity is a function of the electric field and has a
   time-dependent response.

**Conditions:**

#. The medium is linear, homogeneous, and isotropic.
