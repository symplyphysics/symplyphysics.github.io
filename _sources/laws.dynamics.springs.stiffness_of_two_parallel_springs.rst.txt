Stiffness of two parallel springs
=================================

If two springs are side-to-side to one another, i.e. connected in parallel, the total
stiffness of the system of springs is equal to the sum of the stiffnesses of each
spring.

**Condition:**

#. Springs must be Hookean, or linear-response, i.e. obey the Hooke's law.
