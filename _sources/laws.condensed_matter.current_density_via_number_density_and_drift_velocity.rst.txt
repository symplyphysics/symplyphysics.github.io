Current density via number density and drift velocity
-----------------------------------------------------

Current density is the amount of charge per unit time that flows through a unit area of a chosen
cross section. The current density vector is defined as a vector whose magnitude is the electric
current per cross-sectional area at a given point in space, its direction being that of the motion
of the positive charges at this point.

**Conditions:**

#. Charge carriers carry the the same amount of charge.
