Efflux speed via pressure and density
-------------------------------------

The speed of a fluid flowing out from a small orifice can be expressed as a function
of the fluid's :doc:`hydrostatic pressure <laws.hydro.hydrostatic_pressure_via_density_and_height>`
and density.

**Conditions:**

#. The orifice is very small relative to the horizontal cross-section of the container.
#. The fluid is :ref:`ideal <ideal_fluid_def>`.

.. py:data:: efflux_speed

    Speed of the fluid flowing out of the pipe.

.. py:data:: hydrostatic_pressure

    Hydrostatic pressure of the fluid.

    Symbol:
        :code:`p`

.. py:data:: density

    Density of the fluid.
