Group velocity from dispersion relation
---------------------------------------

Waves can form a group, called wave packets. The speed with which a wave packet travels
is called group velocity. In other words, it is the speed with which the overall envelope
shape of the wave's amplitudes — called envelope of modulation of the wave — propagates
through space.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.laws.waves.group_velocity_from_dispersion_relation

.. py:data:: group_velocity

    Group velocity of the wave packet.

    Symbol:
        :code:`v_group`

    Latex:
        :math:`v_\text{group}`

.. py:data:: angular_frequency

    Angular frequency of the wave as a function of angular wavenumber, also called the
    *dispersion relation* of the wave.

    Symbol:
        :code:`w(k)`

    Latex:
        :math:`\omega(k)`

.. py:data:: angular_wavenumber

    Angular wavenumber of the wave.

    Symbol:
        :code:`k`

.. py:data:: law

    :code:`v_group = Derivative(w(k), k)`

    Latex:
        .. math::
            v_\text{group} = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k}
