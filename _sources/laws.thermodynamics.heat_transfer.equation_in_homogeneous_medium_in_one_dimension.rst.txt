Equation in homogeneous medium in one dimension
-----------------------------------------------

Heat equation governs heat diffusion, as well as other diffusive processes. It describes
the evolution of heat transferred from hotter to colder environments in time and space.

**Notes:**

#. There is no straghtforward solution to this equation, and it depends on initial
   conditions as well.

**Conditions:**

#. There are no heat sources in the system, i.e. the heat distribution only depends on
   the initial conditions.
#. Thermal diffusivity :math:`\chi` does not depend on position.
