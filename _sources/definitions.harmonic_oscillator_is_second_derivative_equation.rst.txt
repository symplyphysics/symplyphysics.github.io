Harmonic oscillator is a second order derivative equation
=========================================================

In classical mechanics a *simple harmonic oscillator* is a system that, after a small displacement from equilibrium, experiences a restoring force :math:`F` proportional to that displacement. Displacement is not only limited to physical motion, but should be interpreted in general terms. Examples include small-angle pendulums, mass–spring systems, acoustic resonators, and electrical RLC circuits.
If :math:`F` is the only force acting on the system, the system is called a simple harmonic oscillator.

**Conditions:**

#. There is no damping (i.e. friction) in the system.
#. The system experiences a single restoring force :math:`F` (for mechanical oscillators).
