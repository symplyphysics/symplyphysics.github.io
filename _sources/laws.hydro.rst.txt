Fluid mechanics
===============

Fluid mechanics is the branch of physics concerned with the mechanics of fluids
(liquids, gases, and plasmas) and the forces on them.

.. _ideal_fluid_def:

**Ideal fluid**

An ideal fluid is a model of fluids often used in fluid mechanics to approximate
the behavior of real fluids. Ideal fluids are:

#. non-viscous, i.e. there is no internal resistance to flow;
#. in steady, or laminar, flow;
#. incompressible;
#. irrotational, i.e. its particles undergo no rotation around their center of mass.
