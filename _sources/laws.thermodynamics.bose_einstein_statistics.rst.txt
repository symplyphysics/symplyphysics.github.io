**Boseâ€”Einstein statistics**
============================

Bose-Einstein statistics is a type of quantum statistics that applies to the physics of a
system consisting of many non-interacting, identical particles that strictly do not obey
the Pauli exclusion principle. Particles following Bose-Einstein statistics are called bosons
and have integer values of spin.
