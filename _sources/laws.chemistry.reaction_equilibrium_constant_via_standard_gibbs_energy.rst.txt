Reaction equilibrium constant via standard Gibbs energy
-------------------------------------------------------

The equilibrium constant is a value that determines for a given chemical reaction the ratio between
thermodynamic activities (or, depending on the conditions of the reaction, partial pressures,
concentrations or fugitives) of reactants and products in a state of chemical equilibrium.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`R` (:code:`R`) is :attr:`~symplyphysics.quantities.molar_gas_constant`.

**Conditions:**

#. The term "standard" applies to a solution of an infinite dilution and of a hypothetical standard
   concentration, typically :math:`1 \text{mol}/\text{kg}`.
