Symbols related to relativistic mechanics.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.symbols.relativistic_mechanics

.. py:data:: lorentz_factor

    **Lorentz factor** is a quantity expressing how much the measurements of time, length, and other physical
    properties change for an object while it moves.

    Symbol:
        :code:`gamma`

    Latex:
        :math:`\gamma`

    Dimension:
        :code:`dimensionless`

.. py:data:: spacetime_interval

    The **spacetime interval** between two events in four-dimensional spacetime is the analog of the
    distance between two points in three-dimensional space. It has a property of being invariant under
    the change of reference frame.

    Symbol:
        :code:`s`

        :math:`s`

    Dimension:
        :code:`length`

.. py:data:: proper_time

    **Proper time** along a timelike world line is defined as the time as measured by a clock following
    that line. The change in proper time, called **proper time interval**, between two events on a world
    line has the property of being Lorentz invariant and is independent of coordinates.

.. py:data:: rest_mass

    **Rest mass**, also called **invariant mass**, **intrinsic mass**, or **proper mass**, is the portion of
    the total mass of an object or a system of objects that is the same in all references frames related by
    Lorentz transformations.

    Dimension:

.. py:data:: proper_length

    **Rest length**, or **proper length**, is the length of an object in the object's rest frame.
