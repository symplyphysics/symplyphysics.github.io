Phase speed from angular frequency and wavenumber
-------------------------------------------------

*Phase speed* of a wave is the rate at which the wave propagates in a medium.
It is the speed at which the phase of one frequency component of the wave travels.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.laws.waves.phase_velocity_from_angular_frequency_and_wavenumber

.. py:data:: phase_speed

    Phase speed of the wave.

    Symbol:
        :code:`v`

.. py:data:: angular_frequency

    Angular frequency of the wave.

    Symbol:
        :code:`w`

    Latex:
        :math:`\omega`

.. py:data:: angular_wavenumber

    Angular wavenumber of the wave.

    Symbol:
        :code:`k`

.. py:data:: law

    :code:`v = w / k`

    Latex:
        .. math::
            v = \frac{\omega}{k}
