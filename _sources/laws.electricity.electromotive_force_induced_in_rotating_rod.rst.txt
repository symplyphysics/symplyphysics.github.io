Electromotive force induced in rotating rod
-------------------------------------------

Let a rod rotate in a uniform magnetic field. The plane of rotation is perpendicular
to the magnetic field lines. The axis of rotation passes through one of the ends of
the rod. A wire is connected at both ends of the rod so that it makes a contour.
Then the electromotive force induced at the ends of the rod depends on the magnitude
of the magnetic flux density, the rotation frequency and the length of the rod.

**Conditions:**

#. The angular velocity of the rod is parallel to the magnetic field. This means that
   the rod is rotating in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field.
#. The magnetic field is uniform.
#. The angular velocity of the rod is constant.
