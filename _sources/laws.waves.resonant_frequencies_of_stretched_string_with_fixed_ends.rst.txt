Resonant frequencies of stretched string with fixed ends
--------------------------------------------------------

For a string with fixed ends there is only a limited set of frequencies at which standing waves will
occur on it. Each possible frequency is a resonant frequency, and the corresponding wave pattern is
an oscillation mode. The oscillation mode corresponding to :math:`m = 1` is called the fundamental mode or
the first harmonic, the mode corresponding to :math:`m = 2` is the second harmonic, and so on.
