Rotational inertia about axis and through center of mass
--------------------------------------------------------

The *parallel-axis theorem* relates the rotational inertia of a body about any axis to
that of the same body about a parallel axis that extends through the body's center of mass
of mass).


**Conditions:**

#. The two axes must be parallel to each other.
#. The axis used in the calculation of :math:`I_\text{com}` must pass through the body's center of mass.
