Efflux speed via height
-----------------------

The speed of a fluid flowing out from a small orifice can be expressed as a function
of the height of the fluid column. It is also known as the *Torricelli's law*.

**Conditions:**

#. The orifice is very small relative to the horizontal cross-section of the container.
#. The fluid is :ref:`ideal <ideal_fluid_def>`.
#. The fluid is subjected to the gravity force of Earth.
