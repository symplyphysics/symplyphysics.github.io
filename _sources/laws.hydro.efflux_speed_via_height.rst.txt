Efflux speed via height
=======================

The speed of a fluid flowing out from a small orifice can be expressed as a function of
the height of the fluid column. It is also known as the **Torricelli's law**.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`g` (:code:`g`) is :attr:`~symplyphysics.quantities.acceleration_due_to_gravity`.

**Conditions:**

#. The orifice is very small relative to the horizontal cross-section of the container.
#. The fluid is :ref:`ideal <ideal_fluid_def>`.
#. The fluid is subjected to the gravity force of Earth.
