Angle of light deflection in prism
----------------------------------

A prism, an optical prism, is a body made of a homogeneous material transparent to optical radiation,
bounded by flat reflecting and refractive surfaces located at strictly defined angles to each other.
With a small angle of incidence of the incoming beam, the angle of deflection of the beam depends only
on the angle between the faces of the prism and the refractive index of the prism.

**Conditions:**

#. The deviation angle and the incident angle are small.

    Imagine a ray falling on the prism and a ray coming out of the prism. Let's continue these rays inside
    the prism. Then the angle of intersection of these rays, looking towards the output beam, will be called
    the angle of deviation.
