Gibbs energy via enthalpy
-------------------------

Gibbs energy is a thermodynamic potential that can be used to calculate the maximum amount of work
that may be performed by a thermodynamically closed system at constant temperature and pressure.
It provides a necessary condition for processes such as chemical reactions that may occur under these
conditions.
