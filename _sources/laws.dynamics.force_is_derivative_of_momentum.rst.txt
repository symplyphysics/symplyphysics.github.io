Force is derivative of momentum
-------------------------------

Newton's second law of motion can be generalized in terms of linear momentum. Precisely,
the net force exerted on a body is equal to the time derivative of the body's momentum.

**Notes:**

#. Works in relativistic mechanics as well as in classical mechanics.
