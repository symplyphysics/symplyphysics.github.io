Mixture mass is sum of component masses
=======================================

The mass of a mixture of fluids is equal to the sum of the masses of the components of
the mixture.

**Conditions:**

#. Mixture in a closed impenetrable volume, that is, its molecules cannot leave it and
   they are always inside;
#. Mass is not transformed to energy, for example due to annihilation.
