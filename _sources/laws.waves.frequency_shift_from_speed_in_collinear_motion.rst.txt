Frequency shift from speed in collinear motion
----------------------------------------------

The *Doppler effect* or *Doppler shift* is the apparent change in frequency of a wave in
relation to an observer moving relative to the wave source.

**Notes:**

#. When the source is moving with speed equal to wave speed, the observed frequency goes
   to infinity. This effect is known as the *sonic boom*.

**Conditions:**

#. The source and observer speeds are less or equal to the wave speed. Otherwise emitted
   waves are left behind the source or never reach the observer.
#. The source and observer are moving directly towards or away from each other (collinear
   motion).
