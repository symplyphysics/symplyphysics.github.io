Longitudinal frequency shift from speed
---------------------------------------

Doppler effect is also applicable to electromagnetic waves in vacuum. As there is no any medium
required for these waves to propagate, speed of source related to observer is used for the
calculation of the Doppler effect.

**Notes:**

#. This is a special case, when wave speed in medium (vacuum) is close to speed of light. But
   relativistic version of classical Doppler effect is more general case, that includes
   non-electromagnetic waves.

**Conditions:**

#. Source and observer are moving directly towards or away from each other.
#. Wave speed is close to speed of light. It means this law is only applicable to
   electromagnetic waves.
#. Motion is in 1D space.
