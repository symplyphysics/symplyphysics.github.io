Speed of charged particles in gas via mobility
==============================================

In a gas, the free path length of charged particles is small and the particles, as they
move, experience many collisions in the volume between the electrodes. In this case, the
speed of directional movement will depend not on the potential difference traveled, but
on the local value of the electric intensity.
