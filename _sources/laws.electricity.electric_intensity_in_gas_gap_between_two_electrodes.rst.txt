Electric field in gas gap between two electrodes
================================================

Consider a two-electrode gas-filled gap with flat electrodes. Let one of the electrodes
emit charged particles into a gaseous medium. If the potential collecting these charged
particles is set to another electrode, then a current will flow through the gap.

**Conditions:**

#. Emittivity of the emitter is unlimited, i.e. emission of charged particles is much
   greater than current between electrodes.
#. There is gaseous medium between electrodes.
