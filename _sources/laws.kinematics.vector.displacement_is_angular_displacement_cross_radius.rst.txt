Linear displacement is angular displacement cross radius
--------------------------------------------------------

Assuming a body rotating around a fixed axis, the vector of its linear displacement can be expressed
as the cross product of the pseudovector of angular displacement and the radius vector of rotation.

**Conditions:**

#. The axis is fixed.
#. Angular displacement pseudovector and radius vector must be orthogonal to one another.
