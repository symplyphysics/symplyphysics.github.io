Electric flux through closed surface via total charge
=====================================================

Known as **Gauss's law**, it states that the electric flux through any closed surface :math:`S` is equal to
the total charge within volume :math:`V` enclosed by that surface, and in the SI units, divided by the
vacuum permittivity. The closed surface is also referred to as **Gaussian surface**.

**Conditions:**

#. :math:`S = \partial V`, i.e. surface :math:`S` encloses volume :math:`V`. In other words, the surface
   must be closed.
