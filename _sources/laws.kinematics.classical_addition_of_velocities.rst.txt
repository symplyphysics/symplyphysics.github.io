Classical addition of velocities
--------------------------------

The *law of classical addition of velocities*, usually attributed to Galileo and called the
*Galilean law of velocity addition*, states that the velocity of a body in an inertial reference
frame :math:`A` can be found as a sum of its velocity in another inertial reference frame :math:`B` and the
velocity of frame :math:`B` relative to frame :math:`A`.

**Conditions:**

#. Velocity vectors must be collinear.
#. Space and time are absolute.
#. Applicable to inertial reference frames.
