Wave equation in one dimension
------------------------------

The *wave equation* is a second-order linear partial differential equation used to
describe the propagation of waves, including standing wave fields such as mechanical
or electromagnetic waves.

**Notes:**

#. This equation is called one-dimensional because the displacement function depends
   only on one spatial dimension.

.. py:data:: displacement

    Factor representing a displacement from rest position, which could be
    pressure, position, electric field, etc., as a function of position
    and time.

    Symbol:
        :code:`u(x, t)`

.. py:data:: position

    Position, or spatial variable.

    Symbol:
        :code:`x`

.. py:data:: time

    Time.

    Symbol:
        :code:`t`

.. py:data:: phase_speed

    :doc:`Phase speed <laws.waves.phase_velocity_from_angular_frequency_and_wavenumber>` of the wave.

    Symbol:
        :code:`v`

.. py:data:: definition

    :code:`Derivative(u(x, t), (x, 2)) = (1/v^2) * Derivative(u(x, t), (t, 2))`

    Latex:
        .. math::
            \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}
