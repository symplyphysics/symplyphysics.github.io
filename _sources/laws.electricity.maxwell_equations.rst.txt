**Maxwell equations**
=====================

**Maxwell's equations** describe how electric charges and electric currents create electric
and magnetic fields. They are a set of coupled partial differential equations that, together
with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, classical
optics, electric and magnetic circuits.
