Magnetic field of coil
----------------------

Near the center of the coil, the magnetic field is quite uniform and directly
proportional to the current in the coil's wire.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`\mu_0` (:code:`mu_0`) is vacuum permeability.

**Conditions:**

#. The medium is vacuum.
#. The magnetic field is measured near the center of the coil.
