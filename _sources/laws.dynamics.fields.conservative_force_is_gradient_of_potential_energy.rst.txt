Conservative force is gradient of potential energy
==================================================

A conservative force is a such a force, the total work of which in moving a particle between two
points is independent of the path taken. Alternative definition states that if a particle travels
in a closed loop, the total work done by a conservative force is zero.

**Conditions:**

#. Force is conservative. Mathematically, this can be expressed as
   :math:`\text{curl} \, {\vec F} \left( \vec r \right) \equiv 0`, i.e. the force field must
   be irrotational.
