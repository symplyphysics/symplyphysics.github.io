Mechanical energy is constant
=============================

Mechanical energy is constant in a system that has only gravitational forces or in an
otherwise idealized system â€” that is, one lacking dissipative forces, such as friction
and air resistance, or one in which such forces can be reasonably neglected.

**Notes:**

#. SymPy does not have a proper way to represent constant energy. We use it's derivative
   over time instead. Derivative of the constant value is zero.
