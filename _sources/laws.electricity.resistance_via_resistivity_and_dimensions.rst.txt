Resistance via resistivity and dimensions
-----------------------------------------

In the ideal conditions described below, the resistivity of a conductor is proportional
to its length and the inverse of its cross-sectional area. The constant of proportionality
is called resistivity of the material. Unlike resistance, resistivity is an intrinsic
property of the material and does not depend on its geometry.

**Conditions:**

#. The cross section is uniform throughout the conductor.
#. The current flows uniformly.
#. The conductor is made of a single material.
#. The electric field and current density are parallel and constant everywhere.
