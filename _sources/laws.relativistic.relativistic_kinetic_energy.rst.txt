Relativistic kinetic energy
===========================

The kinetic energy of an object is the form of energy that it possesses due to its motion.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`c` (:code:`c`) is :attr:`~symplyphysics.quantities.speed_of_light`.

**Notes**

#. The work expended accelerating an object from rest approaches infinity as the velocity approaches the
   speed of light. Thus it is impossible to accelerate an object across this boundary.
