Voltage is electric field times distance
========================================

Voltage between two points in space can be found as the negative line integral of the electric
field across the path that connects those points. In the case of a constant electric field it can
be simplified to the product of the electric field strength and the distance between the points,
multiplying by the necessary sign.

**Conditions:**

#. The electric field is constant between the two points. This might be achieved by
   choosing a small enough distance between the points.

#. The electric field must be conservative, i.e. this law only applies in the electrostatic case.
