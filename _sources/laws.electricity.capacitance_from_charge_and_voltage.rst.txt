Capacitance from charge and voltage
===================================

The electrical *capacitance* of an object is a physical quantity that describes the capability
of the object to store energy in the form of an electric charge. It is directly proportional to
the charge accumulated in the object and inversely proportional to the voltage across it.

**Notes:**

#. This equation can be seen as the definition of *self-capacitance*.

#. This law can be used to as well calculate the *mutual capacitance* of two conductive bodies
   whose net charge is zero, e.g. a parallel-plate capacitor, in which case :math:`q` is the
   magnitude of the electric charge of the plates and :math:`V` is the voltage between the plates.
   In other cases, the `capacitance matrix <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance#Capacitance_matrix>`__
   must be used.
