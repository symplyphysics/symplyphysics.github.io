Absolute magnitude of stars from apparent magnitude and distance
----------------------------------------------------------------

Absolute magnitude can be calculated using apparent magnitude and distance to the object.

.. py:data:: absolute_magnitude

    Absolute magnitude for stars is defined as the apparent magnitude of an object if it were located at a distance
    of 10 parsecs (2.063e+6 astronomical units) from the observer and would not experience either interstellar or atmospheric absorption.

.. py:data:: apparent_magnitude

    The apparent magnitude is a measure of the brightness of a celestial body (more precisely, the illumination created
    by this body) from the observer's point of view. The brighter the object, the smaller its magnitude.

    Dimension:
        :code:`dimensionless`

.. py:data:: distance

    Distance to the object.

    Latex:
        :math:`d`

    Dimension:
        :code:`length`

.. py:data:: distance_constant

    Constant equal to :math:`2.063e+6` astronomical units.

.. py:data:: law

    :code:`M = m - 5 * log(d / d0, 10)`


    Latex:
        .. math::
            M = m - 5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{d}{d_0} \right)
