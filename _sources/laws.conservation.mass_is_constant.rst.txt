Mass is constant
----------------

The mass is constant in a system that is closed, and mass is not transformed to energy.

**Conditions:**

#. System in a closed impenetrable volume, that is, molecules/atoms cannot leave it and
   they are always inside.
#. Mass is not transformed to energy, for example due to annihilation.

**Note:**

#. SymPy does not have a proper way to represent constant mass. We use it's derivative
   over time instead. Derivative of the constant value is zero.
