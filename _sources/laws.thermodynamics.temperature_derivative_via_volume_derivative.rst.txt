Temperature derivative via volume derivative
--------------------------------------------

The *Joule—Thompson effect* describes the change in temperature that accompanies the expansion of
a gas without production of work or transfer of heat, which is in effect an isenthalpic process.

**Notes:**

#. The left-hand side of the equation is also called the *Joule—Thompson coefficient*.

**Conditions:**

#. Particle count is assumed to be constant.
#. Heat capacity is assumed to be independent of temperature.
