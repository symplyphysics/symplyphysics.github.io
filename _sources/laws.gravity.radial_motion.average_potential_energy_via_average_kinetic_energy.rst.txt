Average potential energy via average kinetic energy
---------------------------------------------------

The average potential energy of an orbiting planet is directly proportional to its average
kinetic energy. The average of both energies is taken w.r.t. time.

**Conditions:**

#. Works for elliptical orbits, i.e. the total energy :math:`E` of the planet is negative.

.. py:data:: average_potential_energy

    The potential energy of the planet averaged over time.

    Symbol:

    Latex:
        :math:`\langle U \rangle`

.. py:data:: average_kinetic_energy

    The kinetic energy of the planet averaged over time.

    Symbol:
        :code:`avg(K)`

    Latex:
        :math:`\langle K \rangle`

.. py:data:: law

    :code:`avg(U) = -2 * avg(K)`

    Latex:
        .. math::
            \langle U \rangle = -2 \langle K \rangle
