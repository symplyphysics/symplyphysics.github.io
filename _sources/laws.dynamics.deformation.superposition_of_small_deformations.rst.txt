Superposition of small deformations
-----------------------------------

If the deformations are small, the elastic properties of bodies stay the same under deformations.
If several forces act on a body, its total deformation can be computed from the deformations of
the individual forces, however these deformations must be small.

**Conditions:**

#. The deformations are small.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.laws.dynamics.deformation.superposition_of_small_deformations

.. py:data:: total_strain

    Total strain of the body.

    Symbol:
        :code:`e`

.. py:data:: first_strain

    Strain caused by one force.

    Symbol:
        :code:`e_1`

    Latex:
        :math:`e_1`

.. py:data:: second_strain

    Strain caused by another force.

    Symbol:
        :code:`e_2`

    Latex:
        :math:`e_2`

.. py:data:: law

    :code:`e = e_1 + e_2`

    Latex:
        .. math::
            e = e_1 + e_2
