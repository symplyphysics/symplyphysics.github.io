Superposition of small deformations
===================================

If the deformations are small, the elastic properties of bodies stay the same under deformations.
If several forces act on a body, its total deformation can be computed from the deformations of
the individual forces, however these deformations must be small.

**Conditions:**

#. The deformations are small.
