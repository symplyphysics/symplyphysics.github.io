Proper time for timelike intervals
----------------------------------

In relativity, proper time along a timelike world line is defined as the time as measured by a clock following
that line. The proper time interval between two events on a world line is the change in proper time, which is
independent of coordinates, and is a Lorentz scalar.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`c` (:code:`c`) is :attr:`~symplyphysics.quantities.speed_of_light`.

**Conditions**

#. The interval is timelike, i.e. :math:`\Delta s` is real.
