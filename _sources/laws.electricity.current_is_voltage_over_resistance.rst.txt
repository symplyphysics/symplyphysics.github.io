Current is voltage over resistance
==================================

Current flowing through a conductor is proportional to voltage applied to it and
inversely proportional to its resistance. This is also known as the **Ohm's law**.

**Notes:**

#. This is a phenomenological equation.

**Conditions:**

#. The material must be ohmic, i.e. current must be proportional to voltage.
