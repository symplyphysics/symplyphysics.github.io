Symbols of physical quantities related to chemistry.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.symbols.chemistry

.. py:data:: mass_fraction

    **Mass fraction** of a substance within a mixture is the ratio of the mass of the substance to the total mass
    of the mixture.

    Symbol:
        :code:`w`

    Latex:
        :math:`w`

    Dimension:
        :code:`dimensionless`

.. py:data:: amount_of_substance

    **Amount of substance** in a given sample of matter is defined as a ratio between the number of elementary
    entities and the Avogadro constant.

    Symbol:
        :code:`n`
