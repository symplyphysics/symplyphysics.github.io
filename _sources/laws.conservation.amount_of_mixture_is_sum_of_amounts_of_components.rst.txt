Amount of mixture is sum of amounts of components
=================================================

The total amount of the mixture is equal to the sum of the amounts of each of the components.

**Conditions:**

#. Mixture in a closed impenetrable volume, that is, molecules/atoms cannot leave it and
   they are always inside;
#. Mass is not transformed to energy, for example due to annihilation.
