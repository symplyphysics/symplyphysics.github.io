Capacitance from charge and voltage
-----------------------------------

The electrical *capacitance* of an object is a physical quantity that describes the capability
of the object to store energy in the form of an electric charge. It is directly proportional to
the charge accumulated in the object and inversely proportional to the voltage across it.

.. py:data:: charge

    Charge accumulated in the object.

    Symbol:
        :code:`q`

.. py:data:: voltage

    Voltage across the object.

    Symbol:
