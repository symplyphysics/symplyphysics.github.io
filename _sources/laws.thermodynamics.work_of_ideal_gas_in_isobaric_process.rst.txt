Work of ideal gas in isobaric process
-------------------------------------

An isobaric process is a process that occurs at constant pressure. The work done
by the gas is proportional to the pressure of the gas and its volume change.

**Conditions:**

#. The gas is ideal.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.laws.thermodynamics.work_of_ideal_gas_in_isobaric_process

.. py:data:: work

    Work done by the gas during the isobaric process.

    Symbol:
        :code:`W`

.. py:data:: pressure

    Pressure of the gas, constant during the process.

    Symbol:
        :code:`p`

.. py:data:: initial_volume

    Initial volume of the gas.

    Symbol:
        :code:`V0`

    Latex:
        :math:`V_0`

.. py:data:: final_volume

    Final volume of the gas

    Symbol:
        :code:`V1`

    Latex:
        :math:`V_1`

.. py:data:: law

    :code:`W = p * (V1 - V0)`

    Latex:
        .. math::
            W = p (V_1 - V_0)
