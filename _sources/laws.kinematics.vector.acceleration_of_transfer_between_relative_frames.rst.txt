Acceleration of transfer between relative frames
------------------------------------------------

Imagine two reference frames, one of which is fixed (:math:`S`) and the other one is moving (:math:`S'`). The motion of
a body stationary in moving frame :math:`S'` due to the motion of the frame itself is called transfer motion.
The acceleration related to such motion is called transfer acceleration. It is composed of the acceleration
of the moving frame relative to the fixed frame, centripetal acceleration and the acceleration due to uneven
rotation of the moving frame. The transfer acceleration only depends on the motion of frame :math:`S'` relative to
stationary frame :math:`S`, so its physical meaning would be that it is the acceleration in :math:`S` of a point stationary
in :math:`S'`.
