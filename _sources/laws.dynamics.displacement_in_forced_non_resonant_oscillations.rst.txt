Displacement in forced non-resonant oscillations
------------------------------------------------

*Forced, or driven, oscillations* are a type of oscillations in the presence of an external driving
force acting on the oscillating system. In the case of an oscillating external force, two angular
frequencies are associated with such a system: (1) the natural angular frequency of the system,
which is the angular frequency the system would oscillate with if no external force were present,
and (2) the angular frequency of the external force driving the oscillations.

**Conditions:**

#. Angular frequency of the external force is strictly not equal to the natural angular frequency of the oscillator.
#. No damping is present in the system.

**Notes:**

#. The external driving force has the form of :math:`f(t) = f_m \cos{\left( \omega t + \varphi \right)}`.
#. The complete expression of the displacement function can be found as the sum of the solution of 
   simple harmonic motion equation and the particular solution presented here.

        `displacement` is a sympy Symbol, therefore auto-generation of formulas is impossible

    :code:`q(t) = F / (m * (w0^2 - w^2)) * cos(w * t + phi)`

    Latex:
        .. math::
            q(t) = \frac{F}{m \left( \omega_0^2 - \omega^2 \right)} \cos{\left( \omega t + \varphi \right)}
