Entropy derivative via volume derivative
----------------------------------------

Maxwell relations are a set of equations that unite the most common thermodynamic quantities between
one another. They are derived from the fundamental themodynamic relations featuring differentials
of thermodynamic potentials, and this method of derivation is called the method of thermodynamic
potentials.
