Acceleration due to non-uniform rotation
----------------------------------------

Imagine two reference frames, one of which is fixed (:math:`S`) and the other is moving (:math:`S'`). When :math:`S'` rotates
around :math:`S` in a non-uniform way, the acceleration of some body :math:`B` in :math:`S` has a component corresponding to
that non-uniform rotation of :math:`S'`. It is part of the transfer acceleration of body :math:`B` in :math:`S`.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`\vec a \times \vec b` (:code:`cross(a, b)`) is vector product of :math:`\vec a` and :math:`\vec b`.
