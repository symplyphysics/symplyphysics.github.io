Electric field of uniformly charged plane
-----------------------------------------

The electric field strength of a uniformly charged plane is proportional to its
charge density.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`\varepsilon_0` (:code:`epsilon_0`) is vacuum permittivity.

**Conditions:**

#. The plane is thin, i.e. its thickness approaches zero.
#. The plane is in vacuum.
