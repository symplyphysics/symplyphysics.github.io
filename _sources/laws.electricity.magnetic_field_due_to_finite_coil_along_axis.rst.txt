Magnetic field due to finite coil along axis
============================================

Using the Biot—Savart law, it is possible to obtain the formula for the magnetic flux density at
any point on the axis of a coil. It is directly proportional to the coil's turn count and current
and inversely proportional to its length, and also depends on the position of the measurement
point relative to the coil ends.

**Conditions:**

#.  The point of measurement must lie on the axis of the coil.

#.  The medium is a vacuum.

#.  The :math:`z`-axis is the axis of rotation and is oriented according to the right-hand side
    rule.
