Specific conductivity of coaxial waveguide
------------------------------------------

A coaxial waveguide is an electrical cable consisting of a central conductor and a shield arranged coaxially and separated
by an insulating material or an air gap. It is used to transmit radio frequency electrical signals.
The specific conductivity of a coaxial waveguide depends on the frequency of signal and the specific capacitance of coaxial waveguide,
as well as on the tangent of the dielectric loss angle of the insulator material.
In general, the tangent of the dielectric loss angle is a characteristic of the material. The angle itself is usually not searched for or indicated.
The tangent of this angle is found as the ratio of the active current to the reactive current. The value of this value for each material is in the tables
in the public domain.
