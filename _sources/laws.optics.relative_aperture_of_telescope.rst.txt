Relative aperture of telescope
==============================

The relative aperture of a telescope is the ratio of the diameter of the lens to its focal length.
For visual observations, high-power telescopes give a larger exit pupil size, that is, the picture
is bright and clear. A larger field of view allows you to observe extended objects, which include
many galaxies and nebulae, that is, objects from Outer Space. In turn, non-high-power telescopes
give a greater magnification, other things being equal, and are used in working with objects where
details need to be considered, that is, with planets.
