Symbols related to thermodynamics.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.symbols.thermodynamics

.. py:data:: temperature

    Temperature is a scalar quantity that quantitatively expresses the attribute of hotness and coldness. It reflects
    the average kinetic energy of the vibrating and colliding atoms making up a substance.

    Symbol:
        :code:`T`

    Latex:
        :math:`T`

    Dimension:
        :code:`temperature`

.. py:data:: adiabatic_index

    **Adiabatic index**, or **heat capacity ratio**, is the ratio of heat capacity at constant pressure to that
    at constant volume.

    Symbol:
        :code:`gamma`

    Latex:
        :math:`\gamma`

    Dimension:
        :code:`dimensionless`

.. py:data:: heat_capacity

    **Heat capacity** or **thermal capacity** is a physical property of matter, defined as the amount of heat to be
    supplied to an object to produce a unit change in its temperature.

    Symbol:
        :code:`C`

    Latex:
        :math:`C`

    Dimension:
        :code:`energy/temperature`

.. py:data:: thermal_expansion_coefficient

    **Thermal expansion coefficient** describes how the size of an object changes with a change in temperature at
    constant pressure.

    Symbol:
        :code:`alpha`

    Latex:
        :math:`\alpha`

    Dimension:
        :code:`1/temperature`
