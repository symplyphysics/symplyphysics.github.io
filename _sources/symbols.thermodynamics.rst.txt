Symbols related to thermodynamics.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.symbols.thermodynamics

.. py:data:: temperature

    Temperature is a scalar quantity that quantitatively expresses the attribute of hotness and coldness. It reflects
    the average kinetic energy of the vibrating and colliding atoms making up a substance.

    Symbol:
        :code:`T`

    Latex:
        :math:`T`

    Dimension:
        :code:`temperature`

.. py:data:: adiabatic_index

    **Adiabatic index**, or **heat capacity ratio**, is the ratio of heat capacity at constant pressure to that
    at constant volume.

    Symbol:
        :code:`gamma`

    Latex:
        :math:`\gamma`

    Dimension:
        :code:`dimensionless`

.. py:data:: heat_capacity

    **Heat capacity** or **thermal capacity** is a physical property of matter, defined as the amount of heat to be
    supplied to an object to produce a unit change in its temperature.

    Symbol:
        :code:`C`

    Latex:
        :math:`C`

    Dimension:
        :code:`energy/temperature`

.. py:data:: thermal_expansion_coefficient

    **Thermal expansion coefficient** describes how the size of an object changes with a change in temperature at
    constant pressure.

    Symbol:
        :code:`alpha`

    Latex:
        :math:`\alpha`

    Dimension:
        :code:`1/temperature`

.. py:data:: thermodynamic_compressibility

    **Compressibility** is a measure of the instantaneous relative volume change of a fluid or solid as a response
    to a pressure or mean stress change.

    Symbol:
        :code:`beta`

    Latex:
        :math:`\beta`

    Dimension:
        :code:`1/pressure`

.. py:data:: thermal_resistance

    **Thermal resistance** measures the opposition to the heat current in a material or system.

    Symbol:
        :code:`R`

    Latex:
        :math:`R`

    Dimension:
        :code:`temperature/power`

.. py:data:: thermal_conductivity

    **Thermal conductivity** of a material is a measure of its ability to conduct heat. It is defined as the
    proportionality coefficient between the heat flux and the temperature gradient.

    Symbol:
        :code:`k`

    Latex:
        :math:`k`

    Dimension:
        :code:`power/(length*temperature)`

.. py:data:: thermal_insulance

    The **R-value**, or **thermal insulance**, is a measure of how well a two-dimensional barrier, such as a layer of
    insulation, a window or a complete wall or ceiling, resists the conductive flow of heat, in the context of construction.

    Symbol:
        :code:`R_val`

    Latex:
        :math:`R_\text{val}`

    Dimension:
        :code:`area*temperature/power`

.. py:data:: compressibility_factor

    The **compressibility factor**, also known as the **compression factor** or the **gas deviation factor**,
    describes the deviation of a real gas from ideal gas behavior.

    Symbol:
        :code:`Z`

    Latex:
        :math:`Z`

    Dimension:
        :code:`dimensionless`
