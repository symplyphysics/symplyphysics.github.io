Displacement in underdamping
----------------------------

In the presence of a damping force in the oscillating system, the system's behavior
depends on the value of the damping ratio. When it is less than :math:`1`, the system oscillates
with a slightly different frequency than in the undamped case, and its amplitude decreasing
to zero. This behavior is also known as *underdamping*.

**Conditions:**

#. The system is underdamped, i.e. its damping ratio :math:`\zeta < 1`.
