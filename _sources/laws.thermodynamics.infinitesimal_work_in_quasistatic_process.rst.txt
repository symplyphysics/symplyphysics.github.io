Infinitesimal work in quasistatic process
=========================================

For a process in a closed system, occuring slowly enough for it to be quasi-static (i.e. the system
remains in internal physical, but not necessarily chemical, thermodynamic equilibrium), the infinitesimal
increment of work done *by* the system is related to the pressure inside the system and the infinitesimal
increment of volume of the system.

**Notation:**

#. :math:`\delta` (:code:`delta`) denotes that the increment is an inexact, path-dependent differential.
#. :math:`d` denotes that the increment is an exact, path-independent differential.
