Damped angular frequency
------------------------

A damped oscillator performs oscillations with a frequency proportional
to that of an undamped oscillator, i.e. to the frequency of an oscillator when
there is no damping force acting on the system.

**Notes:**

#. In the case of overdamping when the damping ratio is greater than 1, the value of damped
   angular frequency becomes imaginary, which indicates the absence of oscillations.
