Optical path length from geometrical path length and refractive index
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*Optical path length*, also known as *optical length* or *optical distance*, is the
length that light needs to travel through a vacuum to create the same phase difference
as it would have when traveling through a given medium.

*Geometrical path length* is the Euclidean distance integrated along a light ray
between any two points.

**Conditions:**

#. The environment must be homogeneous.
