Symbols related to optics.

.. py:currentmodule:: symplyphysics.symbols.optics

.. py:data:: relative_refractive_index

    **Relative refractive index** of of an optical medium is a dimensionless number that gives the
    indication of the light bending ability of that medium. It is defined relative to a certain medium.

    Symbol:
        :code:`n`

    Latex:
        :math:`n`

    Dimension:
        :code:`dimensionless`

.. py:data:: radiant_exitance

    **Radiant exitance** or **radiant emittance** is the radiant flux emitted by a surface per unit area.

    Symbol:
        :code:`M_e`

    Latex:
        :math:`M_\text{e}`

    Dimension:
        :code:`power/area`

.. py:data:: radiant_flux

    **Radiant flux** or **radiant power** is the radiant energy emitted, reflected, transmitted, or
    received per unit time.

    Symbol:
        :code:`Phi_e`

    Latex:
        :math:`\Phi_\text{e}`

    Dimension:
        :code:`power`

.. py:data:: focal_length

    The **focal length** of an optical system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges
    light; it is the inverse of the system's optical power. It is the distance between the focal plane and
    the lens's nodal point.

    Symbol:
        :code:`f`

    Latex:
        :math:`f`

    Dimension:
        :code:`length`
